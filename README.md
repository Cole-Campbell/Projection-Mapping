This repository is for my interactive projection mapping project I will be working on for my Video II class.

For this project, I will be using processing and VPT to produce my final product. I will be using a Kinect XBox 360 (Gen1) camera to track people who interact with my project. My project will be recreating the classic "Following eyes" portraits. I will be taking the tracking data collected from the Kinect camera and interpret the data to then move the pupels of the portrait, to then literally follow a person. I will be playing around with the threshold of the depth map so it will pick up to a certain range.

Additionally, once the project is up and running I will want to incorporate some fun with these portraits and more interactivity such as if the user gets closer, the eyes could possible cross, or become bigger as the Kinect detects that they are getting closer. I will potentially also be looking into gestures and if Kinect can register certain gestures, if this is possible then I will add some animations and interactivity doing so.

The library I am using to access the Kinect camera is OpenKinect <https://openkinect.org/wiki/Main_Page> which can easily be downloaded from your Processing application in the menu. Sketch > Import Library > Add Library > Search OpenKinect.
